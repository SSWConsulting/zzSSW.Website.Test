The scenario for the Angular test is:

A SSW Developer has started to create a CMS driven version of our Consulting in Angular. A sample of the existing pages is: https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Bots.aspx

They are having problems styling the main content of the page (which is the "Bots in Action" section of the sample content. Repo for the CMS driven version is at: https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Website.Test

The new page with the content from the Bot sample can be accessed at: /consulting/bots

1. Update the CSS so that "Bot in Action" section looks like the existing page.
2. The developer also needs help with the CSS for the Testimonials section. The company name needs to be aligned to the left with the person's name.
3. Please add the hover animation to the book initial meeting button.
