Hi,

As per our conversation, I started to write a CMS driven version of our Consulting pages in Angular. A sample of an existing page is:
 https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Bots.aspx

I’m having problems styling the main content of the page (which is the "Bots in Action" section of the sample content). The Repo for the CMS driven version is at:
 https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Website.Test

Can you please help me out with this?

The new page with the content from the Bot sample can be accessed at: /consulting/bots

1.	Clone the repo. git clone https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Website.Test.git ssw-website
2.	Create a branch for your updates.
3.	Update the CSS so that "Bot in Action" section looks like the existing page.
4.	I also need help with the CSS for the Testimonials section. The company name needs to be aligned to the left with the person's name.
5.	Please add the hover animation to the book initial meeting button.
6.	Create a pull request for your branch and let me know that you’re done

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch.

Cheers,
Greg
