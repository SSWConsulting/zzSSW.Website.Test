Hi,

As per our conversation, I started to write a CMS driven version of our Consulting pages in Angular. I'm tryng to show SSW managment the excisting aspx page can be easily migrated. A sample of an existing page is:
 https://www.ssw.com.au/ssw/Consulting/Bots.aspx

I’m having problems styling the main content of the page (which is the "Bots in Action" section of the sample content). The Git Repo for the CMS driven version is:
 https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Website.Test

Can you please help me out with this?

The new page with the content from the Bot sample can be accessed at: /consulting/bots

1.	Clone the repo. git clone https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Website.Test.git ssw-website
2.	Create a branch for your updates. (optional)
3. 	Problem #1 formatting of the CSS in the section "Bot in Action".
4.	Problem #2 formatting of the CSS in the section "Testimonials". 
5.	Problem #3 please add the hover animation to the button "Book a FREE initial meeting".
6.	Create a pull request for your branch (optional)
7.  Let me know that you’re done.

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch.

Cheers,
Greg
